# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)



## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I generated the map using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/). 


users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
